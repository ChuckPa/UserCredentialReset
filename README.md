User Credential Reset and Server Reclaim Utility
            - for Plex Media Server


# Introduction

after a hard password reset or account change.

It runs on the Linux command line with 'root' privilege level so it may edit Plex's files

6. Western Digital (OS5 models â€“ PR,DL, and Ultra)
7. Non-standard Linux installations, including Docker, when path to Preferences.xml is known.

# Prerequisites

1. A Plex Media Server account at https://app.plex.tv
2. A valid server Prefernces.xml containing the MachineID and ProcessedMachineID fields.
3. 'curl'  (C-utl) utility for your host.

Manual Path specification (which includes containers and custom) (See below)


# How to use this tool.

1.   Stop Plex

2.  Place the tar file (upload) on the host.  (See recommended locations above)

3.  Open a terminal window or SSH session to the host and sign in.
    (Windows users can use Putty utility)

4.  Elevate command line privileges to 'root'  (`sudo bash`)

5.  Extract the utility from the tar file
```
    cd DIRECTORY_FROM_ABOVE
    tar xf ./UserCredentialReset.tar
    ls UserCredentialReset.*
```
    You will see file `UserCredentialReset.sh`

6.  Make it executable
```
    chmod +x UserCredentialReset.sh
```

7.  Invoke the utility  `./UserCredentialReset.sh`

8.  It will confirm the host platform type (so it knows what to do)

9.  It will confirm you have sufficient user privilege and PMS is stopped

10.  It will then prompt for a "Plex Claim Token".

11.  Open a browser tab to:    https://plex.tv/claim

12.  COPY the given token

13.  WITHIN the next 4 Minutes,     PASTE the token on the utility's command line
    (The token expires so we need be quick)

14.  Hit Enter and it will immediately complete the task. (5-20'ish seconds)

15.  When complete,  It will verify all your credentials are valid and then update Preferences.xml for you

16.  It will print out your Plex username and email used in case you have multiple accounts.

17.  Utility exits.

18.  Start PMS.  It will be back to normal.


**PLEASE** don't hesitate to ask if questions or issues.


# Special Usage cases

  If your PMS configuration is not using one of the above predefined configurations,
  You may specify the path to the Preferences.xml file using the `-p` option.

  Using `-p "/path/to/Preferences.xml` bypasses host type checking.

  However, it does confirm PMS is stopped and sufficient "root/admin" privilege is active.

  Example:
  ```
  [/tmp] # ./UserCredentialReset.sh -p "/mnt/docker/Plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml"
  ```


# How it looks in use  (as seen on a QNAP)

```
[~] # chmod +x UserCredentialReset.sh
[~] # ./UserCredentialReset.sh
